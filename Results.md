## Key Observations

1. **Execution Time**: 
   - No quantization was fastest (7.63s), followed closely by 4-bit (8.61s)
   - 8-bit was significantly slower (28.48s), mainly due to response generation time

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - 4-bit quantization used the least peak GPU memory (2332.77 MB)
   - No quantization used the most GPU memory (7296.52 MB), over 3x more than 4-bit
   - 8-bit quantization was in between (3877.68 MB)

3. **Loading Time**:
   - Model loading was fastest with no quantization (2.87s)
   - 8-bit quantization took the longest to load (7.24s)

4. **RAM Usage**:
   - All configurations showed significant increases in both system and process RAM
   - 8-bit quantization had the highest final RAM usage (System: 1913.28 MB, Process: 1187.52 MB)

5. **Response Generation**:
   - 8-bit quantization took substantially longer (19.23s) compared to 4-bit (3.10s) and no quantization (2.59s)

6. **Memory Freeing**:
   - All configurations efficiently freed GPU memory after task completion
   - No quantization took slightly longer to free memory (0.22s vs 0.09s for quantized versions)

## Implications

1. **Performance vs Memory Trade-off**: 
   - No quantization offers best performance but at high memory cost
   - 4-bit quantization provides a good balance of speed and memory efficiency
   - 8-bit quantization significantly impacts performance while offering moderate memory savings

2. **Resource Allocation**: 
   - Systems with limited GPU memory should consider 4-bit quantization
   - High-performance systems can benefit from no quantization for faster execution

3. **Application Scenarios**:
   - Real-time applications might prefer 4-bit or no quantization for faster response
   - Memory-constrained environments could opt for 4-bit quantization
   - 8-bit quantization might be suitable for non-time-critical tasks where some memory saving is desired

4. **Model Optimization**: 
   - Investigating the significant performance drop in 8-bit quantization could lead to optimization opportunities
   - Exploring the use of 'flash-attention' package could potentially improve performance across all configurations
